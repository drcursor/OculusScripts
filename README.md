# Oculus Scripts
Useful scripts for Oculus Rift

## Usage
All of these scripts need to be run with administrator permissions

## StopOculus.bat

Stops the Oculus Service. Useful if you need to stop Oculus home from autostarting or to store the HMD with any kind of cover that would otherwise trigger the screens.

## StartOculus.bat

StopOculus.bat nemesis... Starts the service so you can use it again.

## FixCPU.bat

Sets a false CPU ID on the windows Registry so that Oculus home stops displaying the nagging "Your computer doesn't meet Rift's recommended specifications" message
