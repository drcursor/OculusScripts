Stops the Oculus Service. Useful if you need to stop Oculus home from autostarting or to store the HMD with any kind of cover that would otherwise trigger the screens.

# StartOculus.bat

StopOculus.bat nemesis... Starts the service so you can use it again.

# FixCPU.bat

Sets a false CPU ID on the windows Registry so that Oculus home stops displaying the nagging "Your computer doesn't meet Rift's recommended specifications"
